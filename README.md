"# ColorPaletteExtractor" 

**Project Overview**

C. P. E (Color Palette Extractor) is an Android app that allows the user to extract a color palette out of a picture taken with the phone, or uploaded from the gallery. The user can then edit or/and store the palette in the application. They can also copy the color codes from the extracted palette and use them for other purposes.
